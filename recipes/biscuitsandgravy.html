<h2>Directions</h2>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whisk 2 cups flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a bowl; cut shortening into flour mixture with a pastry cutter until mixture is crumbly. Mix in egg and milk until incorporated. Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface and knead for 1 minute.</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Roll dough out to a thickness of 3/4 to 1-inch thick, cut with a biscuit cutter, and place biscuits onto prepared baking sheet. Brush tops of biscuits with melted butter.

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cook and stir sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir 1/4 cup butter into sausage until butter has melted and mix in 1/4 cup flour until thoroughly combined. Pour evaporated milk and water into sausage mixture, bring gravy to a simmer, and reduce heat to low; simmer gravy until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season gravy with salt and black pepper to taste.</p>
